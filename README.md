Exploratory Data Analysis --> Comparative Analysis of Companies: (Spain vs. France)

Welcome to the Comparative Analysis of Companies: Spain vs. France EDA project! This repository contains the code and datasets used for conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of companies located in Spain and France.

## Project Overview

The main focus of this project is to compare and contrast the characteristics of companies in Spain and France. The code provided in this repository performs various data cleaning, visualization, and exploration techniques to gain insights into the datasets.

## What's Included

This repository includes the following:

1. **Code**: The code files are available for your reference. You can explore the step-by-step analysis, data manipulation, and visualizations implemented during the EDA process.

2. **Data Spain / France**: The datasets used in this analysis are available for download. They include information on company names, job positions, offered salaries, overall ratings, and sectors for both Spain and France, obtained by web-scraping "https://www.glassdoor.es/".
   
3.  **Data Spain Salary Distribution**: The information of salary distribution in Spain was downloaded from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtljtl/spain-salary-distribution".

## How to Use
